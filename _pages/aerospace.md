<h3>Research</h3>
From June 2020 to June 2021, I worked as an undergraduate researcher in the <a href="https://starlab.mit.edu/">MIT Space, Telecommunications, Astronomy, and Radiation Lab</a> (also known as STAR Lab). <br> <br> My work so far has been focused on attitude controls for <a href="https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/beavercube.htm">BeaverCube</a>, an underactuated (magnetorquer-only) 3U ocean-observing CubeSat with propulsion onboard. <br> <br> I contributed to <a href="https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4728&context=smallsat">a paper</a> about BeaverCube's mission goals and engineering approach.

<h3>Work Experience</h3>
From June 2020 to August 2020, I interned at <a href="https://www.agi.com/">Analytical Graphics, Inc</a>.

I worked with two other interns on developing a concept for a CubeSat communications constellation to serve responders to natural disasters in areas without ground communications. We modeled our individual CubeSats and constellation in STK; I focused on the power and attitude control subsystems, as well as an optical communications system for crosslinking between satellites. At the end of the summer, we submitted a paper on the project and presented to the rest of the company.

I also got my STK Level 1, Level 2 (Master), and Level 3 (Grand Master) <a href="https://www.agi.com/training-and-certification#cert">certifications</a>, as well as an ODTK Level 1 Certification and the Level 2 STK-Python Integration certification.
