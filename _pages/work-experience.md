<h3>E-Space</h3>
From June 2021 to August 2021, I interned at <a href="https://www.e-space.com/">E-Space</a>.

At the time, E-Space was a stealth startup with approximately 10 employees. Although I was an intern, I was the attitude control lead during summer 2021. I developed a physics-based attitude control and orbital dynamics simulation to model E-Space's magnetorquer-only control system, based on some of my <a href="/research">undergraduate research in STAR Lab</a>. I also developed a novel algorithm to quickly extract sun and Earth horizon position from an infrared camera commercially available at Home Depot. Finally, I tested, speed-optimized, and extended a nonlinear optimization algorithm for planning magnetorquer-only slews based on prior STAR Lab research.

<h3>Analytical, Graphics, Inc.</h3>
From June 2020 to August 2020, I interned at <a href="https://www.agi.com/">Analytical Graphics, Inc</a>.

I worked with two other interns on developing a concept for a CubeSat communications constellation to serve responders to natural disasters in areas without ground communications. We modeled our individual CubeSats and constellation in STK; I focused on the power and attitude control subsystems, as well as an optical communications system for crosslinking between satellites. At the end of the summer, we submitted a paper on the project and presented to the rest of the company.

I also got my STK Level 1, Level 2 (Master), and Level 3 (Grand Master) <a href="https://www.agi.com/training-and-certification#cert">certifications</a>, as well as an ODTK Level 1 Certification and the Level 2 STK-Python Integration certification.

<h3> Microsoft</h3>
I interned at Microsoft three times: in summer 2017, 2018, and 2019.

Most recently, in summer 2019, I worked as a software engineering intern on the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/itshowcase/blog/how-microsoft-is-transforming-the-way-it-fights-security-threats/">Digital Security and Risk Engineering (DSRE)</a> Red Team. I wrote a program that scraped Twitter for cybersecurity-related tweets, used a convolutional neural net (CNN) to identify which tweets were most relevant to Microsoft's security, and displayed the most relevant tweets on an internal company website. My code also linked tweets to <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/">publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities</a> to identify which known bugs were most discussed on social media and thus most currently relevant.  

Before that, in summer 2018, I interned on a data management team in DSRE as part of the <a href="https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/job/870951/Internship-Opportunities-for-Students-Explore-Program">Microsoft Explore program</a>. I worked with two other interns to design and implement a data monitoring dashboard, using the full Azure stack.

Finally, in summer 2017, I interned on the same data management team in DSRE as part of the <a href="https://careers.microsoft.com/students/us/en/ushighschoolprogram">Microsoft high school intern program</a>. In this role, I wrote code to clean and process data. I also did some data analysis for the Insider Threat team.
