<h3>Work Experience</h3>
I interned at Microsoft three times: in summer 2017, 2018, and 2019.

Most recently, in summer 2019, I worked as a software engineering intern on the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/itshowcase/blog/how-microsoft-is-transforming-the-way-it-fights-security-threats/">Digital Security and Risk Engineering (DSRE)</a> Red Team. I wrote a program that scraped Twitter for cybersecurity-related tweets, used a convolutional neural net (CNN) to identify which tweets were most relevant to Microsoft's security, and displayed the most relevant tweets on an internal company website. My code also linked tweets to <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/">publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities</a> to identify which known bugs were most discussed on social media and thus most currently relevant.  

Before that, in summer 2018, I interned on a data management team in DSRE as part of the <a href="https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/job/870951/Internship-Opportunities-for-Students-Explore-Program">Microsoft Explore program</a>. I worked with two other interns to design and implement a data monitoring dashboard, using the full Azure stack.

Finally, in summer 2017, I interned on the same data management team in DSRE as part of the <a href="https://careers.microsoft.com/students/us/en/ushighschoolprogram">Microsoft high school intern program</a>. In this role, I wrote code to clean and process data. I also did some data analysis for the Insider Threat team.
