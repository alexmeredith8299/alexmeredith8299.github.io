<br><h1> Hi, I'm <span style="color:blue">Alex Meredith</span>!</h1>
<br>I'm a third-year PhD student in the <a href="https://acl.mit.edu/">Aerospace Controls Laboratory</a> at MIT working with <a href="http://www.mit.edu/people/jhow/">Jonathan How</a>. I'm funded by the NSF GRFP and a Draper fellowship. My research interests include robust control of nonlinear systems, adaptive control, safe control, and safe learning.
<br><br> Previously, I completed my master's degree in the <a href="https://starlab.mit.edu/">Space Telecommunications, Astronomy, and Radiation (STAR) Lab</a> at MIT and was supervised by <a href="https://aeroastro.mit.edu/people/kerri-cahoy/">Kerri Cahoy</a>.
<br><br>In my free time, I enjoy rock climbing, hiking, and biking around Cambridge, MA.
